This repository is a very simple game that emulates a very simple card game

On this game each player take one card on his turn. They switch until they have 3 cards. 

If the sum of the cards is *15* then the game is over. Any other way, in their next turn they should drop a card and pick another one until one player wins.

This code includes the full Xcode project and some unit tests.
